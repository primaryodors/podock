# Sample POdock configuration file.
#
# Modify this or create fresh.
#

# Path to PDB of protein (required):
PROT ../olfaction/cached/OR1A1/OR1A1.metal.pdb

# Path to PDB or SDF of ligand (required):
LIG ../sdfs/ALLYLPHA.sdf

# XYZ coordinates of center of binding pocket (required):
# Active pocket
CEN -4.93883 5.08067 -4.91533
# Inactive pocket
# CEN 1.6535 2.67575 2.286

# Optional path. If given, POdock will attempt to move the ligand along the
# path and report the binding energy at each node. Note these XYZ coordinates
# are relative to the previous node - these are not absolute coordinates!
# The pocket center is considered to be node zero.
# Nodes must be numbered from 1 to n, where n < 256.
# PATH 1 -2.0 -2.5 -0.5
# PATH 2 -2.0 -2.5 -0.5
# PATH 3 2.0 -2.5 -1.0
# PATH 4 1.0 -2.5 -0.5

# Pocket size. If one number is given, it forms the radius of a sphere
# centered around the pocket center. If three numbers are given, they form
# the XYZ radii of an aspect-ratio-distorted spheroid centered around
# the pocket center.
# Default: 10.0.
SIZE 6.0 7.5 5.5

# Optional metal coordination residues. Don't give the amino acid and don't
# include any non-numeric characters; just give the residues' sequence numbers.
# MCOORD 176 179 180

# Maximum number of poses to output. Default 10.
POSE 10

# Minimum total binding energy in kJ/mol for output poses.
# Normally this should be either a cutoff threshold for pose screening
# or a small negative number to find all valid poses. Setting this to positive
# may cause impossible poses to be output, e.g. where atoms are incorrectly
# placed inside each other's van der Waals radii.
ELIM -0.01

# Uncomment this to enable kcal/mol output instead of the default kJ/mol.
# KCAL

# Side chain flexion: active if nonzero. Default: 1.
FLEX 1

# Number of iterations per path node per pose.
# Higher values equal more precision but decreasing gains and longer processing
# times. Multiples of 10 work best. Default: 50.
ITERS 50

# Optional output file for docking results. Use a file path with filename,
# no spaces. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.
# For best results, include the receptor name (e.g. OR1A1, TAAR5) in the output filename.
# OUT output/receptor_ligand.dock
